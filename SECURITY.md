# Security

## What's supported

Version 0.1.x gets security updates. That's it for now.

## Use this responsibly

Ghost is for:
- Testing your own systems
- Defensive security work
- CTF competitions
- Security research and learning

Don't use it on systems you don't own or don't have permission to test.

## Found a vulnerability?

Don't open a public issue. Create a private security advisory on GitHub instead.

I'll respond within 48 hours. Critical stuff gets fixed in a week, other issues within a month.

## Stuff to know

- Advanced malware can evade this
- Kernel rootkits are invisible to userspace tools
- Each platform has its own limitations
- Running this on production systems has overhead

Keep Ghost updated and test only where you're allowed.
